    <p>A tabletop role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game where players assume the roles of fictional characters 
      and create stories and adventures together. These games are typically played with a group 
      of friends or acquaintances and are facilitated by one person called the game master (GM) or dungeon master (DM). 
      The GM acts as the storyteller and referee, guiding the game and controlling non-player characters (NPCs) and the game world.

      <p>Below talks about the different components of a game. 
        Note, anything with a * next to it most people will understand, but we've provided the text incase you want to read further.</p>

              Rule System: RPGs have a set of rules that govern how the game is played. These rules define the capabilities 
              and limitations of the characters, the outcomes of actions, and the resolution of conflicts. Some popular rule systems 
              include: Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, and Shadowrun

              Players create their own unique characters, often referred to as player characters (PCs), 
              by selecting attributes, abilities, skills, and backgrounds. These choices shape the character's abilities and personality.

              Players are in charge of playing their characters, the Game Master(GM) is in charge of running everything else. Setting, NPCs (characters the pcs run into in the story), and combat.
              The GM is frequently playing the role of a story guide and referee. It is up to the GM's call also on whether or not the rules can change, or to interpret a confusing rule. Game Master 
              is the most common term used across systems, but some systems have their own term for this role. In Dungeons and Dragons, this person is called the Dungeon Master. 
              PRO TIP: do not argue with the GM in the middle of game, that is typically bad manners. Asking for a rules clarification however, is completely fine.

              RPGs take place in a fictional setting, which can be anything from a medieval fantasy realm to a futuristic science fiction universe. 
              The GM provides details about the world, its history, and the current situation to help players immerse themselves in the setting.

              RPGs focus on collaborative storytelling. The GM presents a scenario or an overarching story arc, and players interact with the world and other characters, 
              making decisions and taking actions that advance the narrative. The GM describes the outcomes based on the rules and the players' choices.

              RPGs often include combat encounters and other challenges that test the characters' skills and abilities.
