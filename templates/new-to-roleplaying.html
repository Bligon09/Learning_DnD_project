    <p>A tabletop role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game where players assume the roles of fictional characters 
      and create stories and adventures together. These games are typically played with a group 
      of friends or acquaintances and are facilitated by one person called the game master (GM) or dungeon master (DM). 
      The GM acts as the storyteller and referee, guiding the game and controlling non-player characters (NPCs) and the game world.

      <p>Below talks about the different components of a game. 
        Note, anything with a * next to it most people will understand, but we've provided the text incase you want to read further.</p>

              Rule System: RPGs have a set of rules that govern how the game is played. These rules define the capabilities
