        In D&D 5th Edition, the alignment system is a way to describe a character's moral and ethical outlook, providing a general guideline 
        for their behavior and decision-making. Here's a brief explanation of the alignment system:
        Alignment has two aspects: a character's moral alignment (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic) and their ethical alignment 
        (Good, Neutral, or Evil). These aspects combine to form nine possible alignments:
        <li>Lawful Good (LG): Characters with this alignment value order, justice, and the greater good.
             They strive to uphold laws and act in a way that benefits others.</li>
        <li>Neutral Good (NG): Characters with this alignment seek to do good but may not be bound by strict rules. 
            They prioritize kindness, compassion, and doing what they believe is right.</li>
        <li>Chaotic Good (CG): Characters with this alignment value personal freedom and individuality. 
        They act on their own principles and often rebel against authority if they perceive it as oppressive.</li>
        <li>Lawful Neutral (LN): Characters with this alignment believe in order and structure. They adhere to laws and 
        regulations but may prioritize maintaining the system over individual moral judgments.</li>
        <li>True Neutral (TN): Characters with this alignment maintain a balance between good and evil, law and chaos. 
        They often act in their own self-interest or based on circumstances rather than adhering to strict moral or ethical codes.</li>
        <li>Chaotic Neutral (CN): Characters with this alignment value personal freedom and individual choice above all else. 
        They are unpredictable, following their own whims and desires without regard for rules or conventions.</li>
        <li>Lawful Evil (LE): Characters with this alignment believe in using laws and systems to further their own evil ends. 
        They are often manipulative and seek power and control over others.</li>
        <li>Neutral Evil (NE): Characters with this alignment prioritize their own interests and desires, 
        often without regard for the well-being of others. They act selfishly and opportunistically.</li>
        <li>Chaotic Evil (CE): Characters with this alignment revel in chaos and destruction. They seek personal 
            gratification and inflict pain and suffering on others without remorse.</li>
        It's important to note that alignment is a guideline and not an absolute determinant of a character's actions. Characters can exhibit traits and behaviors that don't perfectly align with their stated alignment, and their alignment may evolve or change throughout their adventures.
        Alignment can be a useful tool for players and Dungeon Masters to understand a character's moral compass and motivations, but ultimately, it's up to the players to bring their characters to life and make decisions that reflect their personality, background, and beliefs.

    In D&D 5th Edition, backgrounds provide additional flavor, skills, and story hooks to a character's backstory. 
    They represent the character's life before becoming an adventurer and help shape their personality, skills, and 
    connections.</p>
    <p>here are some backgrounds. The book has more you can choose from, 
    but these work really well for fighters</p></div>

    You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, 
    collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar 
    with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a 
    disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about
    the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.<br>

    You’ve witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller 
    could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are 
    in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where 
    you don’t know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.<br>

    <label for="Sailor"><strong>Sailor</strong>: You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, 
    monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the 
    distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.<br>
    Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Perception<br>
    Tool Proficiencies: Navigator’s tools, vehicles (water)<br>

    <input type="radio" name="backgrounds" value="Soldier" id="Soldier">

    of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.<br>
